    <!--
        Whenever we have a user facing string, we need to put it into the strings.xml file. This is
        so that we can translate it later, and change it without having to do a ton of refactoring.

        To reference the string from XML (such as in a layout), use @string/name, in this example
        @string/hello_world

        To reference the string from Java, you need to call getString(R.string.name), in this
        example getString(R.string.hello_world), on a valid Context. Since Activity implements
        Context, you can call getString() anywhere inside an Activity.
    -->
    <string name="hello_world">Hello World!</string>
